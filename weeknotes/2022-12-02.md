Weeknotes

The Open Innovations Christmas party took place on Thursday, so your editor is typing whilst nursing a large and strong cup of coffee.

We're building a prototype tool for the UK Parliamentary Digital Service. The purpose of the tool is to show what information people can glean from the Register(s) of Members' Financial Interests. Stuart and Giles had a "splendid" (actual client feedback klaxon) show and tell with the team to check our early-stage prototype was heading the right direction. The good news is that it is, so expect to see more on this soon!

Christian is furiously writing documentation for the economic dashboard, in the hope and expectation that people start using the tool soon.

Our Warm Spaces Finder Directory has been shared with sponsors and got some very positive feedback, and requests from external orgs/ individuals to be added.

The OI team is rarely all in the same place at the same time. We're consciously trying to address the lack of opportunity to  by agreeing on a Wednesday afternoon co-working session. We're starting to explore using [Gather](https://gather.town) to facilitate this. Gather is a playful and proximity-based collaboration tool: you control an avatar which walks around a virtual office space. It's interesting how this puts some of us into a different mode of interaction than YATMâ„¢ (Yet Another Team Meeting).

In events news, next week's Open Data Saves Lives on 7th Dec is sold out! You'll be able to catch up with the recording after the event, so don't panic. There's also a date for next Northern Economic Data user group, which is 23rd February 2023. Mark your calendars!

Giles has been working on generalising a set of [visualisations we developed for Youth Futures Foundation](https://data.youthfuturesfoundation.org/sample/). They're a bit specific to YFF in their current form, but with a bit of work we'll be able to roll them out to other projects really quickly!

We're keen to keep the carbon footprint of our code as small as possible. Giles was therefore interested to come across the [Green Software Foundation](https://greensoftware.foundation/). There are a couple of particularly useful bits of information. Firstly, the [Principles of Green Software Engineering](https://principles.green/) is a good summary of the sort of things we think about. There's also useful list of [Green Software](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/awesome-green-software). As an aside, the home page the Green Software Foundation could do with some work, given the results we found by running [it through the Website Carbon Caculator](https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/greensoftware-foundation/).

Everybody (well, some people) are talking about the fediverse. Giles found [Marcus Hutchin's analysis of the strength of Mastodon as far as moderation goes](https://escapingtech.com/tech/opinions/i-was-wrong-about-mastodon-moderation.html) to be an interesting read.
