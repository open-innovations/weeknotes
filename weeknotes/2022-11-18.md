* Open Innovations is having a go at writing weeknotes. This is our first attempt to see how it works out for our team, and what form they should take. Here are some suggested principles:

  * Keep them short and link out
  * Whole team contribution, single editor
  * New editor each week
  * Publish on the web and share via our regular channels
  * Rough and ready but published is better than polished and late
* Experiments with [DVC](https://dvc.org) to catalogue commonly used reference data. We've created a [reference library](https://github.com/open-innovations/reference-data) of data we use frequently. We're also using DVC to manage pipelines of data processing in our work with [Leeds 2023](https://data.leeds2023.co.uk).
* We've been building a [hexmap of all the wards in the UK](https://open-innovations.org/projects/hexmaps/builder.html?maps/uk-wards-2022.hexjson&colourscale=Viridis8&borders=false&attribute=Attributes&labels=false). [Can you help?](https://github.com/odileeds/hexmaps/tree/gh-pages/maps/uk-wards-2022)
* Work on the [Leeds Digital Festival](https://open-innovations.github.io/leeds-digital-festival-data/) microsite is progressing! We're reusing the stack that we've developed for the Leeds 2023 and Youth Futures Foundation codebases on this project. This gives us another point of reference for what it makes sense to make re-usable, and what is specific to the other projects.
* We've noticed a lot of Warm Spaces Finders out there. We've started cataloguing them in a ["Warm Spaces Finder" Finder](https://open-innovations.github.io/warm-spaces/) ([code on Github](https://github.com/open-innovations/warm-spaces)).
* We've made the move to Notion to manage our projects and pipeline, and for some internal note-sharing.
