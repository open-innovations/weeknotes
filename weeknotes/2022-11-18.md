* The Open Innovations team is having a go at writing weeknotes. This is our first attempt to see how it works out for our team, and what form they should take. Here are some suggested principles:

  * Keep them short and link out
  * Whole team contribution, single editor
  * New editor each week
  * Publish on the web and share via our regular channels
  * Rough and ready but published is better than polished and late
* Giles has been experimenting with [DVC](https://dvc.org) to catalogue commonly used reference data. He's created a [reference library](https://github.com/open-innovations/reference-data) of data we use frequently. He's also using DVC to manage pipelines of data processing in our work with [Leeds 2023](https://data.leeds2023.co.uk).
* Stuart has been building a [hexmap of all the wards in the UK](https://open-innovations.org/projects/hexmaps/builder.html?maps/uk-wards-2022.hexjson&colourscale=Viridis8&borders=false&attribute=Attributes&labels=false). [Can you help?](https://github.com/odileeds/hexmaps/tree/gh-pages/maps/uk-wards-2022)
* Taz and Dan have been progressing work on the [Leeds Digital Festival microsite](https://open-innovations.github.io/leeds-digital-festival-data/). It's nearly there!! We're reusing the stack that we've developed for the Leeds 2023 and Youth Futures Foundation codebases on this project. This gives us another point of reference for what it makes sense to make re-usable, and what is specific to the other projects.
* We've noticed a lot of Warm Spaces Finders out there. Stuart has started cataloguing them in a ["Warm Spaces Finder" Finder](https://open-innovations.github.io/warm-spaces/) ([code on Github](https://github.com/open-innovations/warm-spaces)).
* Michelle, Taz and Giles have made the move to Notion to manage our projects and pipeline, and for some internal note-sharing.
* Michelle and Giles are carrying on with discussions about LEEDS 2023 data flows. This builds on and codifies tghe work we've been doing on the [LEEDS 2023 data microsite](https://data.leeds2023.co.uk). We also had a brilliant meeting with the LEEDS 2023 accessibility partners about making our visualisations more accessible.
* Giles came across this set of [design patterns for dashboards](https://dashboarddesignpatterns.github.io/patterns.html) looks worth a read. We are doing lot of that sort of thing at the moment, and are always looking for interesting ideas. (Via [@davechild on mastodon.me.Uk](https://mastodon.me.uk/@davechild).)
* Stuart attended an ONS virtual meet-up about their [Climate Change dashboard](https://climate-change.data.gov.uk/)
* Paul attended the launch of the University of Leeds Knowledge Equity Network. Here's [his (short) tweet thread about the event](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1593160313977057280.html). He was asked to deliver [a provocative presentation on Innovating with Data](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iuaeFid9iUzgbdN4690ZmTorVhX3svfvyZJsC1hlh_Q/edit?usp=drivesdk).
* Of course, Stuart and Giles have also built a [website to present these weeknotes](weeknotes.open-innovations.org). You can even see take a look at [the code we've used to build it](https://github.com/open-innovations/weeknotes).
* We have helped to publish [more open data](https://datamillnorth.org/publisher/leeds-2023) on behalf of Leeds 2023, including data about volunteering and a ballot for their opening event.
* Dan has been experimenting with [visualisations](https://dpboam-improved-journey-4pwj5q4j5q4cjprg-3000.preview.app.github.dev/report/arts-council/) for Arts Council England grants data.
