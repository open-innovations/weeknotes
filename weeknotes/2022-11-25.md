Stuart has continued working on the Warm Spaces directory of directories https://open-innovations.org/blog/2022-11-24-finding-a-warm-space-this-winter to add more search/filtering options to [our lightweight warm spaces search tool](https://open-innovations.github.io/warm-spaces/find). If you know of any more [directories of warm spaces](https://open-innovations.github.io/warm-spaces/find) that we are missing, let us know.

Retro on Youth Futures Foundation project.

We have daily (ish) standups, which we run as hybrid sessions where we go round the table talking about things we're working on plans and blockers. Stuart had been tracking the orders, and realised we might have been introducing some inadvertent bias. We use https://www.random.org/lists/ to attempt address this.

Other stuff

Giles has been tinkering with [the weeknotes site](https://weeknotes.open-innovations.org)
a bit more. Firstly, there are now proper meta tags, so sharing via social media
should be a bit more attractive. Checking this is made really simple with the
[Metatags tool](https://metatags.io/), (with an honourable mention for
[Opengraph.xyz](https://www.opengraph.xyz/)). The site is now also consumable as an
[Atom feed](https://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/atom.html), so you can read what we've
been up to get access via a feed reader, like it's 2008 or something. The
[Feedly reader](https://feedly.com) is a good choice, but other solutions are available.
