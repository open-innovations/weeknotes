Brief headline-style weeknotes this week. It's been a busy one, and to be honest
the editor forgot to remind people before this morning!

* Stuart has progressed the [Warm Spaces
  catalogue](https://open-innovations.org/blog/2022-11-24-finding-a-warm-space-this-winter)
  and we now re-list 7084 warm spaces from 59 separate directories. We've shared this with
  various Leeds media outlets, and have been having some great chats with people online.
* Giles updated our [reference data
  repository](https://github.com/open-innovations/reference-data) to include our
  cut down version of the latesst ONS Postcode Directory.
* Giles and Stuart have also been progressing the Register of Members Financial
  Interest work for UK Parliament, and were delighted to have been mentioned
  (and thanked) in [their weeknotes from last
  week](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/meta/weeknotes/2022/48/#interests-financial-and-otherwise).
  Thanks Michael!
* Kathryn and Ruby have hosted some new clients using our space to run
  innovation events: Arla Foods, NDL software, Freixenet Copestick. You could
  join them! [Get in touch to enquire about hiring the innovation

* The [Open Data Saves Lives AI in
  Healthcare](https://opendatasaveslives.org/events/session-36-AI) session was
  really well attended. The recording is now online.
* Paul attended the Labour Party press conference at the University Of Leeds' Nexus innovation space.
* We're in the process of renewing [our

  we've been talking to TPXImpact.

  code skills, who would like to join our small but perfectly formed team? Watch
