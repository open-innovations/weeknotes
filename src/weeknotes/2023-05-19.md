{{ comp.anchor({ ref: 'sprint-5' }) | safe }}
The team completed sprint 5 this week, closing a creditable 40 tickets, with 6 in review, 3 in progress and 2 not yet started.
Full disclosure: we did shift a few around as it became clear we'd been a bit keen filling up the ready column!
We were a bit off the pace with our velocity, in part as we waited for critical information on at least one of our projects, but also as Michelle (who plays a critical role in keeping us delivery focussed!) was on holiday.
We also spent a chunk of time at the start of the sprint focussing our efforts on ensuring our [project hub pages](https://open-innovations.org/projects/) were up to date.
To be fair, we'd probably neglected this critical part of our _#RadicallyOpen_ approach given a couple of pressured months of delivery work, with LSIP, YFF, Leeds 2023, Tax Devolution and many others.
To redress this, we've drafted a helpful checklist of things to do when we start up a project.
With his new found enthusiasm for _automating all the things_ (of which more later), Christian has even suggested creating a few default tickets covering these things in any new GitHub project we create.
One step at a time!
