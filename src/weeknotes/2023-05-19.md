The team completed sprint 5 this week, closing a creditable 40 tickets, with 6 in review, 3 in progress and 2 not yet started.
Full disclosure: we did shift a few around as it became clear we'd been a bit keen filling up the ready column!
We were a bit off the pace with our velocity, in part as we waited for critical information on at least one of our projects, but also as Michelle (who plays a critical role in keeping us delivery focussed!) was on holiday.
We also spent a chunk of time at the start of the sprint focussing our efforts on ensuring our [project hub pages](https://open-innovations.org/projects/) were up to date.
To be fair, we'd probably neglected this critical part of our _#RadicallyOpen_ approach given a couple of pressured months of delivery work, with LSIP, YFF, Leeds 2023, Tax Devolution and many others.
To redress this, we've drafted a helpful checklist of things to do when we start up a project.
With his new found enthusiasm for _automating all the things_ (of which more later), Christian has even suggested creating a few default tickets covering these things in any new GitHub project we create.
One step at a time!

And finally, Giles came across the [Accessible Numbers](https://accessiblenumbers.com) site when it was [shared on Mastodon by Leigh Dodds](https://mastodon.me.uk/@ldodds/110390090273810342). The site is packed full of useful guidance aimed at presenting numbers and data clearly. While the focus of the site is people with dyscalculia, low numeracy and maths anxiety, there is a lot in there that would benefit anyone trying to present data in an way that people can use. Sort of begs the question “why do it any other way?”. Definitely something that we will be reflecting upon as we help put more data on the web.

And (even more) finally, Paul saw this [tweet by Ahmad Barclay](https://twitter.com/bothness/status/1659212976082276354?t=d1X8NuIhl8TKMb98NUJSaQ&s=19) about an amazingly useful
[tool to view and download UK administrative geographies for a given year](https://onsvisual.github.io/uk-topojson/).
Anyone working on data in the UK will be well aware of the complexity and ever-changing nature of boundaries.
We're no exception, and our website contains a handy [reference to UK geographies](https://open-innovations.org/data/geographies).
It's great to have another useful way of dealing with this critical data infrastructure.
