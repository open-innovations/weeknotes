This week Alex Parsons, Anna Powell-Smith published a good report on [Unlocking the value of fragmented public data](https://research.mysociety.org/html/unlocking-fragmented-data/) which has very practical recommandations on how we can do a better job when many organisations are required to publish the same data. To inform the recommendations they talked to various people who've worked with a variety of data publishers/datasets in local and national contexts. They feature [a case study](https://research.mysociety.org/html/unlocking-fragmented-data/l/6.113.qugwb.cvgrg.jx348.qcxpu.html) around our Business Rates errorts as well as [the tools we made to help people contribute to the Leeds City Region Diversity Dashboard](https://research.mysociety.org/html/unlocking-fragmented-data/l/6.117.ytm25.pag0s.lcyzh.mhrou.html). We're glad that it acknowledges the technical/resource constraints that many local authorities face and that things should be made as easy for them as possible - don't require people in local authorities to [publish 5 star linked data](https://5stardata.info/en/) but instead frame things more around enabling data to be brought together from multiple councils consistency and reliability. If most councils were publishing 2 or 3 star data well, 4 and 5 star data could be built from that by one "central" organisation. The recommendations are worth a read.
