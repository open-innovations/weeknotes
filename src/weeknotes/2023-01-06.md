This has been a week of returning to work after a couple of weeks' holiday.

* After a mid-week start, we had a good couple of planning sessions on
  forthcoming projects, and have formulated appropriate plans for kicking off /
  revitalising / closing down.
* Christian has started work on a Tax Devolution project for Northern Powerhouse
  Partnership. More information on this with a kick-off blog next week.
* Stuart has progressed work on the [Warm Spaces finder](https://open-innovations.github.io/warm-spaces/),
  and there are now 11067 warm spaces listed from 116 separate directories.
  There are still gaps, so please help out if you can!
* We're hiring for an experienced technical consultant who can do bits of data
  and code, whilst working in the flexible and agile way that our small team
  does. Take a look at the the
  [blog post that describes the role](https://open-innovations.org/blog/2022-12-13-vacancy-data-projects-technical-consultant)
