* We read an interesting [blog post about data cleaning by Randy Au](https://counting.substack.com/p/data-cleaning-is-analysis-not-grunt) that argues that rather than treat it as "grunt work" it be treated as "a spectrum of reusable data transformations on the path towards doing a full data analysis". Knowing your data is important. It also led us to [a 2020 blog post by Leigh Dodds](https://blog.ldodds.com/2020/01/31/do-data-scientists-spend-80-of-their-time-cleaning-data-turns-out-no/) which pulls apart the [factoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factoid) that "data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning data".
