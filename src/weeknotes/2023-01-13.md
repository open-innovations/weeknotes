* In the week that [Sky News announced they'd made "the first database showing the scale of money entering UK politics"](https://twitter.com/SkyNews/status/1612005028377526272) based on the Register of Members' Financial Interests (RMFI) we've been continuing our work on the RMFI. We created our RMFI Explorer tool last summer to let you explore how much each MP gets from various interests outside of Parliament (that they've registered). We've just augmented it with an extra visualisation and, being us, you can probably guess what it is. Yes, we've [added a hex cartogram](https://open-innovations.org/projects/RMFI/#hexmap). We have other RMFI news...
* We read an interesting [blog post about data cleaning by Randy Au](https://counting.substack.com/p/data-cleaning-is-analysis-not-grunt) that argues that rather than treat it as "grunt work" it be treated as "a spectrum of reusable data transformations on the path towards doing a full data analysis". Knowing your data is important. It also led us to [a 2020 blog post by Leigh Dodds](https://blog.ldodds.com/2020/01/31/do-data-scientists-spend-80-of-their-time-cleaning-data-turns-out-no/) which pulls apart the [factoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factoid) that "data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning data".
