In other news we notice that Google recently stopped their [Federated Learning of Cohorts](https://privacysandbox.com/proposals/floc) replacing it with [Topics](https://privacysandbox.com/proposals/topics/). We had an HTTP Permissions Header set up on our site - `Permissions-Policy: interest-cohort=()` - to [opt out of FLoc](https://plausible.io/blog/google-floc#how-to-opt-out-of-floc-as-a-web-developer-set-a-permissions-policy) so we've updated this to [opt out of Topics](https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/topics#specific-details) using `Permissions-Policy: browsing-topics=()` which just means that visitors to our main site using Chrome won't be opted-in to tracking by Google. However the new Topics API seems to [think about privacy a bit more](https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/topics#privacy-goals) than previous proposals:
  * Topics will be limited to a human curated taxonomy of topics and will attempt to exclude sensitive topics (to be defined);
  * Topics will be binned by week (they need to make sure that each user doesn't have a different start-of-week otherwise the timing of the boundaries may be identifying);
  * A random topic (for a user, that week, on a particular site) will occasionally be returned to advertisers to add some useful privacy noise.

Christian has been delving deeper into tax devolution, working through a few different distribution functions so we can recreate new and/or additional bandings with council tax on the fly from the excellent open [Price Paid Data from the Land Registry](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/price-paid-data-downloads) (including backcasting how these would have had an effect historically). He's also extremely grateful to Giles for for being a coding buddy on a knotty recursive challenge for modelling up some stamp duty changes. Happily, Christian's off to Malta next week for some relaxation, but will be back with more on the tax devo story later in the month.
