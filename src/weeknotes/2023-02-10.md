In other news we notice that Google recently stopped their [Federated Learning of Cohorts](https://privacysandbox.com/proposals/floc) replacing it with [Topics](https://privacysandbox.com/proposals/topics/). We had an HTTP Permissions Header set up on our site - `Permissions-Policy: interest-cohort=()` - to [opt out of FLoc](https://plausible.io/blog/google-floc#how-to-opt-out-of-floc-as-a-web-developer-set-a-permissions-policy) so we've updated this to [opt out of Topics](https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/topics#specific-details) using `Permissions-Policy: browsing-topics=()` which just means that visitors to our main site using Chrome won't be opted-in to tracking by Google. However the new Topics API seems to [think about privacy a bit more](https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/topics#privacy-goals) than previous proposals:
  * They will limit Topics to a human curated taxonomy of topics and will attempt to exclude sensitive topics (to be defined);
  * They will bin Topics by week (they need to make sure that each user doesn't have a different start-of-week otherwise the timing of the boundaries may be identifying);
  * They will occasionally reply to advertisers with a random topic.
