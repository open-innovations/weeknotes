{{ comp.anchor({ ref: 'JRF' }) | safe }}
We've had another week of excellent progress on the [JRF project](https://open-innovations.org/projects/jrf/north-insight-finder/). We've spent a lot of time working on our [geographical tree structure](https://github.com/open-innovations/jrf-insight/issues/43), which is important because it will be one of the main ways people navigate through the site. We are creating static web pages, but generating them dynamically based on a list of geographies we want to include. This sounds like a simple task, but it isn't when you consider the intricacies of UK geography (have a look at [this infographic](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/documents/hierarchical-representation-of-uk-geographies-june-2023/explore)), and that each layer (think region, county, local authority and wards) may only have partial coverage. On top of that, UK geographies change each year, which makes everything at least twice as complicated. We've programmed this dynamically so that, in future, we should be able to extend our site's coverage to other parts of the U.K. as required. There are a few blog posts on the way talking about: U.K. geography and our approach on this project, the data challenges we have faced on the project so far.
