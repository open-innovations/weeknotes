This week Luke has been buried in python scripts processing data for the LSIP page and adding visualisations using OI's lume charts. He's also working on a blog to explain what the LSIP project is and how Open Innovations is involved, so keep an eye out for that!

Christian has spent the week turning grey and losing sleep as the final modelling and coding comes together for our Tax Devolution Tool in association with Northern Powerhouse Partnership. The biggest challenge, as it often is in work like this, is finding the right data with the right set of geographic lookups attached. Buried inside MHCLG's council tax statistics are some files with current billing authority codes, some with historic, and some with current ONS geocodes. Getting all of those to lookup to each other has been a challenge! But, (nearly) all done now with just some regional roll-ups to complete and then some improving of the UI and the writing of the user guidance and methodologies. Take a look: [it's available online](https://economic-analytics.shinyapps.io/Tax-Devolution) and you can have a play of fantasy Chancellor!
