Giles came across this excellent and thought-provoking transcription of a talk by [Florian Haas](https://mastodon.social/@xahteiwi) entitled [No, We Won’t Have a Video Call for That!](https://xahteiwi.eu/resources/presentations/no-we-wont-have-a-video-call-for-that/). Florian tackles effective working in distributed teams. The transcription starts with this declaration: _“I normally make my talks available as a video, and a slide deck with full speaker notes. In this case though, I consider it fitting to write the whole thing out, so that you don’t need to watch a full length video in 45 minutes, but can read the whole thing in 15.”_ A lot of the advice in the talk chimes very heavily with the team’s recent focus on a ticketing system (GitHub Project) as an organisational tool for asynchronous collaboration. It feels like adopting this tool has changed the content and frequency of video calls for the better.
