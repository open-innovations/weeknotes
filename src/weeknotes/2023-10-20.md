Giles spent a good chunk of time automating
[the Youth Futures Foundations Data pipeline](https://github.com/open-innovations/yff-data-pipelines)
ahead of the launch of the
[data portal that we've built](https://data.youthfuturesfoundation.org)
The launch was postponed until 24th October, due to some
[delays publishing ONS data](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/articles/1358.aspx)
This has allowed a bit of extra testing and some tweaks to the automation, including building
[a way of triggering the site build when the pipeline repository updates](https://dringtech.com/blog/2023/cross-repo-github-triggers/).
