Giles spent a good chunk of time automating
[the Youth Futures Foundations Data pipeline](https://github.com/open-innovations/yff-data-pipelines)
ahead of the launch of the
[data portal that we've built](https://data.youthfuturesfoundation.org)
The launch was postponed until 24th October, due to some
[delays publishing ONS data](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/articles/1358.aspx)
This has allowed a bit of extra testing and some tweaks to the automation, including building
[a way of triggering the site build when the pipeline repository updates](https://dringtech.com/blog/2023/cross-repo-github-triggers/).

Back in 2019 we [created representative polygons for Northern Powergrid's electricity network](https://open-innovations.org/blog/2019-11-27-building-electricity-distribution-geography). This week Stuart has been revisiting that work to rebuild the polygons using the 2021 Census Output Areas. With four more years of experience, Stuart has been able to automate much more of the process than last time. The automated output still contains a few "holes" - Output Areas that don't appear to have enough customer postcodes to pass a threshold - so Stuart has had a working session with engineers from Northern Powergrid to make human decisions for those. The final map is primarily for Northern Powergrid's next Distribution Future Energy Scenario visualisation but it is also likely to get used in other areas of Northern Powergrid too.
