* This week we have released our [2022 Annual Report](https://open-innovations.org/services/sponsors/reports/2022/) (also available as [a PDF](https://open-innovations.org/services/sponsors/reports/2022/2022-report.pdf) thanks to some print stylesheets). Some parts of the report are generated from [data we collect for our dashboard](https://github.com/open-innovations/dashboard/tree/main/data).
* We've been continuing to improve coverage for our [warm spaces finder tool](https://open-innovations.github.io/warm-spaces/find). It now includes 12,253 warm space offers from 121 different directories. You can get the compiled data as [a JSON file](https://open-innovations.github.io/warm-spaces/data/places.json) or [a GeoJSON file](https://open-innovations.github.io/warm-spaces/data/places.geojson) or see them all [on a map](https://mapper.odileeds.org/?5/54.95239/-3.20801/datamill-0902a2be-f58e-429c-a6aa-6f196ccc45fd). Stuart has also done some preliminary analysis looking at [the number of offers by constituency](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-innovations/warm-spaces/main/data/imd.svg) with each consituency ranked by deprivation. You'd hope that offers of warm spaces were targetted at the areas in most need but, unfortunately, this visualisation doesn't show that pattern.
* We met with folks in the Parliamentary Digital Service to show where we have got up to with [Competency Answerability Dashboard](https://open-innovations.github.io/register-of-members-interests-proto/) that we've been making for them to explore how the Register of Members' Financial Interests could be improved.
* The ONS have been gradually publishing Census 2021 data at fine-grained geographies so we've updated the geographic datasets that we use in the [Leeds City Region Diversity Dashboard](https://open-innovations.github.io/diversity-data/leeds-city-region/?area=E08000035). The new census data gives us better detail on sexuality (previously we relied on a Yorkshire & The Humber level survey from 2018) and has finally allowed us to add the section on gender identity.
