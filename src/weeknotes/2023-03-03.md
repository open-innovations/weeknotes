Christian has been busy working on both our [LSIP project](https://open-innovations.github.io/WNYCC-LSIP/) for West & North Yorkshire Chamber of Commerce, as well as finishing the Council Tax model for our [Tax Devolution](https://economic-analytics.shinyapps.io/Tax-Devolution/) project with Northern Powerhouse Partnership. He's also been preparing for a big internal workshop day next week where we're setting our ambitions high for our Economic Data workstream for the rest of 2023, including an exciting partnership which we'll be announcing shortly! More news next week!
