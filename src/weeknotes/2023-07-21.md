This week has gone by quickly, since a few of the team were out visiting our clients and network! 

Stuart and Taz attended the Northern Powergrid Stakeholder Workshop on Wednesday, where they heard about NPg's plans for open data and offered feedback on their new Open Data Portal. We saw the Portal back in March and it is good to see them working so closely with their users - we wrote down some suggestions in a [blog post](https://open-innovations.org/blog/2023-04-17-opinion-improving-data-portal-feedback) earlier in the year. 

We've been heavily in project wrap-up mode this week for our work with YFF. Our final Show & Tell / Review is coming up on Monday so we are finishing off any final tweaks and amendments. Their data site is looking great (if we do say so ourselves!), and we'll be delighted to continue our relationship with Youth Futures into Phase 3 of our work together. In case you haven't seen it, here is the latest iteration of the [YFF external data dashboard](https://data.youthfuturesfoundation.org/).
