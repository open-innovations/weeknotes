Christian has spent another week on the details of the [Tax Devolution Tool](https://economic-analytics.shinyapps.io/Tax-Devolution) where you can play fantasy Chancellor and change the tax rates for existing and new taxes and see how much they'll raise. This week has seen the incorporation of Tourism Taxes (hotel bed levies) and Employers' NI retention, both of which featured directly in the Northern Powerhouse Partnership's report, [Tax DevoNation](https://www.northernpowerhousepartnership.co.uk/publications/fiscal-devonation-a-blueprint-for-devolving-tax/), which was launched in Liverpool this week and which Christian managed to attend as well. Next week will see the user interface tided up, some user notes written as well as technical and methodological blogs, though if you're feeling brave, you might be able to infer some of that from the codebase for the project which is all online on [GitHub](https://github.com/ChristianSpence/Tax-Devolution).
