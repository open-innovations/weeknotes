* Christian has been working on assembling the raw data for two big projects this quarter: providing the data to support West and North Yorkshire Chamber's LSIP proposal, and a Tax Devolution project for Northern Powerhouse Partnership, looking at how different taxes would raise money in different areas including how they would affect redistribution. He's also finally got around to looking at Parquet files in practice, including storing in, and reading from, URLs rather than local file paths, inspired by [this tweet](https://twitter.com/RobinLinacre/status/1612414425948098560) and the many links in it from Robin Linacre. He'll now likely be rewriting the back-end systems of [EDD](https://economic-analytics.shinyapps.io/EDD-app) and it's many dependent products to take advantage of this format soon.
