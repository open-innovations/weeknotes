This week saw the end of sprint 7, a sprint in which we closed 42 tickets, with 8 in progress and 4 in review. We had 16 not started. We certainly made the progress we needed, and the drop in tickets is down to, in part, needing to focus on multiple projects, some of which (e.g. JRF, Leeds Schools Cultural Engagement tracker) are in an early stage, and not yet broken down to small, finite tasks, and others (e.g. YFF) are in late stages, with a whole series of 'snags' listed.

Stuart added a series of additional visualisations to the OI Lume visualisation library, and he and Giles spent some time making the code a bit more robust, adding type and error checking, etc. We're now using this plugin (or variants of it) across five or more data microsites, so it's important that we make it as error-proof as possible. We'll soon (hopefully) be moving to a v1 release - before which the which point the interface needs to stabilise a bit more!
