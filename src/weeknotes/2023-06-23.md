Open Innovations, formerly ODI Leeds, will be 10 years old (yes we know..!!) in November 2023, and what a ten years it has been for everyone. [This post](https://open-innovations.org/blog/2023-06-21-open-innovations-review) considers our operation, our impact, and looks at our plans for the future as we respond to the economic, social and civic challenges of today and tomorrow. Paul discusses the first 10 years of the business, where we are now, and the our expectations and hopes for the next 10 years of Open Innovations.
