  We've had more good news on sponsorship renewals this week, a busy events space and wrapping up our LSIP project.
  This week marks the start of Sprint 3 - we are blazing through tickets and continually refining our process.
---

* The space has been busy this week! On Monday, we hosted the [Leeds Digital Forum](https://twitter.com/eveyroo/status/1640343750982393859?s=20) with Leeds City Council, sharing what's happening across Leeds in the digital sector. We had another full house on Thursday and Friday, welcoming 100 people for an event by Leeds Institute of Fluid Dynamics from the University of Leeds. We're delighted that Leeds City Council and the University have both renewed their sponsorship for the 9th year running - huge thanks! 

* Delivery Sprint 2 came to an end, having seen the team close off an eye-watering 48 tickets! Equally eye-watering was the number of tickets _not_ delivered. At the end of the sprint, there were 6 tickets in progress and 16 not yet started, 2 of which were still in the backlog. It's early days for the process: it's generally a positive discipline for the team, bringing visibility and structure to our delivery work. The team's mini retrospective in the Sprint planning session highlighted work to be done on estimating, writing clear acceptance criteria and managing commitments. The number of unplanned tickets that entered the sprint after the last planning is in part explained by the perfect storm of two project deadlines (the LEEDS 2023 awards event and LSIP project end) occurring at the same time. You can [read about the delivery process](https://open-innovations.github.io/platform/processes/delivery/) on the Open Innovations platform pages. 

* Giles and Christan had an excellent meeting with the West and North Yorkshire Chamber of Commerce, handing over the MVP version of [the LSIP data site](https://open-innovations.github.io/WNYCC-LSIP) we've been building for them. We have one or two fixes to make, but the work was well received, and we think there's a potential for more work to build strong data-led narratives on skills across West and North Yorkshire. Thanks to Luke for all the hard work on preparing the site for the meeting.

* Taz and Stuart attended a Northern Powergrid workshop about [their existing and future open data](https://www.northernpowergrid.com/network-data). They showcased their [Open Data Portal](https://northernpowergrid.opendatasoft.com/pages/home/) and are keen to hear feedback on its usability and any improvements that could be made to the data. If you have any comments or requests, or have been doing something interesting with their data, [get in touch with Northern Powergrid](https://northernpowergrid.opendatasoft.com/pages/contactform/). 

* Stuart started work on the visualisation for National Grid ESO's Future Energy Scenarios 2023.

* On Wednesday, Giles attended the Digital Culture Awards, for which we were shortlisted in the ['Using Data'](https://digitalculturenetwork.org.uk/awards/2023-using-data/) category for the [LEEDS 2023 Data Microsite](https://data.leeds2023.co.uk/). We were delighted to have been shortlisted for the award and a huge well done to Watershed Arts for taking home the prize! 

* Taz has been working on changes to the [Youth Futures Foundation Data Microsite](https://data.youthfuturesfoundation.org/). We're pleased to be working with YFF for our second year and will be supporting them as their Data Partner in the months ahead to share their research and data analysis on the web. 

* We've been continuing our work, alongside the University of Leeds, The Audience Agency, Leeds City Council, and LEEDS2023 to help [map schools engagement with culture](https://open-innovations.github.io/leeds-schools-cultural-engagement/). This week Michelle has been exploring a wealth of cultural and education data from organisations such as the Department for Education, and Arts Council England. Let us know if you have any ideas for other data sets that might be relevant!

* As well as preparing the LSIP site for handover, Luke continued working on a blog post about the LSIP project and how Open Innovations is involved. On Thursday and Friday he helped run the Leeds Institute of Fluid Dynamics event.

* Louis has been working on launching our refresh of [The Leeds Data Ethics Forum with DLA Piper](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/leeds-data-ethics-forum-hosted-by-open-innovations-and-dla-piper-tickets-596697938597) at the Leeds Digital Steering Group!

* We've updated the [Register of Members' Financial Interests explorer](https://open-innovations.org/projects/RMFI/) to include data from 20th March 2023.

* We've been making some minor improvements to [OI Lume Viz](https://open-innovations.github.io/oi-lume-charts/samples/) so that [CSS color names](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/css-reference/css-color-names.php) can be used and tooltips can be customised.
