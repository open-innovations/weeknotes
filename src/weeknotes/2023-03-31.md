* Stuart started work on the visualisation for National Grid ESO's Future Energy Scenarios 2023.
* Taz and Stuart attended a Northern Powergrid workshop about [their existing and future open data](https://www.northernpowergrid.com/network-data).
* We've been making some minor improvements to [OI Lume Viz](https://open-innovations.github.io/oi-lume-charts/samples/) so that [CSS color names](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/css-reference/css-color-names.php) can be used and tooltips can be customised.
* We've updated the [Register of Members' Financial Interests explorer](https://open-innovations.org/projects/RMFI/) to include data from 20th March 2023.
