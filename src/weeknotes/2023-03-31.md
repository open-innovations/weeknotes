  We've had more good news on sponsorship renewals this week, a busy events space and wrapping up our LSIP project.
  This week marks the start of Sprint 3 - we are blazing through tickets and continually refining our process.

* The space has been busy this week! On Monday, we hosted the [Leeds Digital Forum](https://twitter.com/eveyroo/status/1640343750982393859?s=20) with Leeds City Council, sharing what's happening across Leeds in the digital sector. We had another full house on Thursday and Friday, welcoming 100 people for an event by Leeds Institute of Fluid Dynamics from the University of Leeds. We're delighted that Leeds City Council and the University have both renewed their sponsorship for the 9th year running - huge thanks! 

* Stuart started work on the visualisation for National Grid ESO's Future Energy Scenarios 2023.

* Taz and Stuart attended a Northern Powergrid workshop about [their existing and future open data](https://www.northernpowergrid.com/network-data). They showcased their [Open Data Portal](https://northernpowergrid.opendatasoft.com/pages/home/) and are keen to hear feedback on its usability and any improvements that could be made to the data. If you have any comments or requests, or have been doing something interesting with their data, [get in touch with Northern Powergrid](https://northernpowergrid.opendatasoft.com/pages/contactform/). 

* We've been making some minor improvements to [OI Lume Viz](https://open-innovations.github.io/oi-lume-charts/samples/) so that [CSS color names](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/css-reference/css-color-names.php) can be used and tooltips can be customised.

* We've updated the [Register of Members' Financial Interests explorer](https://open-innovations.org/projects/RMFI/) to include data from 20th March 2023.

* Luke spent the first half of the week on LSIP in preparation for the handover meeting. He continued working on a blog post about the LSIP project and how Open Innovations is involved. On Thursday and Friday he helped cater for people in the space for a Leeds Institute of Fluid Dynamics event. 

* On Wednesday, Giles attended the Digital Culture Awards, for which we were shortlisted in the ['Using Data'](https://digitalculturenetwork.org.uk/awards/2023-using-data/) category for the [LEEDS 2023 Data Microsite](https://data.leeds2023.co.uk/). We were delighted to have been shortlisted for the award and a huge well done to Watershed Arts for taking home the prize!

* Taz has been working on changes to the [Youth Futures Foundation Data Microsite](https://data.youthfuturesfoundation.org/). We're pleased to be working with YFF for our second year and will be supporting them as their Data Partner in the months ahead to share their research and data analysis on the web.

* Louis has been working on launching our refresh of [The Leeds Data Ethics Forum with DLA Piper](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/leeds-data-ethics-forum-hosted-by-open-innovations-and-dla-piper-tickets-596697938597) at the Leeds Digital Steering Group!
