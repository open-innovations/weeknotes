* Stuart started work on the visualisation for National Grid ESO's Future Energy Scenarios 2023.
* Taz and Stuart attended a Northern Powergrid workshop about [their existing and future open data](https://www.northernpowergrid.com/network-data).
* We've been making some minor improvements to [OI Lume Viz](https://open-innovations.github.io/oi-lume-charts/samples/) so that [CSS color names](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/css-reference/css-color-names.php) can be used and tooltips can be customised.
* We've updated the [Register of Members' Financial Interests explorer](https://open-innovations.org/projects/RMFI/) to include data from 20th March 2023.


Luke spent the first half of the week on LSIP in preparation for the handover meeting. After finding some issues in one of the datasets he had to reproduce some of the visualisations with updated data. He continued work on a blog about the LSIP project and how Open Innovations is involved. On Thursday and Friday he helped cater for around 80 people in the space for a Leeds Institute of Fluid Dynamics event.
