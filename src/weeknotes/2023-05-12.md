Another short week, but as ever, the team has packed a lot in!

{{ comp.anchor({ ref: 'lume-charts' }) | safe }}
Stuart and Giles spent some time reviewing our [visualisation library](https://github.com/open-innovations/oi-lume-charts).
We're getting close to a stable library, with a few internal refactorings and a final consistency review to complete before a version one release. You can take a look at the documentation and samples on [the OI Lume Charts site](https://open-innovations.github.io/oi-lume-charts/).
Christian has already started building the backlog for the next visualisation types by suggesting a few new visualisation types.
We will, of course, get him to capture these suggestions as issues in the github repo, as we've begun integrating this work into the sprint process.
