Another short week, but as ever, the team has packed a lot in!

{{ comp.anchor({ ref: 'lume-charts' }) | safe }}
Stuart and Giles spent some time reviewing our [visualisation library](https://github.com/open-innovations/oi-lume-charts).
We're getting close to a stable library, with a few internal refactorings and a final consistency review to complete before a version one release. You can take a look at the documentation and samples on [the OI Lume Charts site](https://open-innovations.github.io/oi-lume-charts/).
Christian has already started building the backlog for the next visualisation types by suggesting a few new visualisation types.
We will, of course, get him to capture these suggestions as issues in the github repo, as we've begun integrating this work into the sprint process.

Kathryn and Paul have been working on the update for the sponsors coffee and cake session we're holding next week.
This is a chance for our sponsors (and other organisations we work with) to update, learn, share and talk about opportunities and future plans.
You can [book your place at Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/open-innovations-sponsors-coffee-cake-am-tickets-620603169787).
