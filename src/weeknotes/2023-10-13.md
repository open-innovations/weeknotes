In updating and relaunching their Inclusive Growth Strategy, Leeds City Council wanted a way to easily track their progress across a set of key economic indicators. This week Christian and Taz have [introduced our Inclusive Growth Dashboard](https://open-innovations.org/blog/2023-10-10-introducing-our-inclusive-growth-dashboard) that was created as part of a year-long relationship to support the council's economic insight.

Our next #OpenDataSavesLives event - [Session 41](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/open-data-saves-lives-tickets-718391126197) - is on the 1st November 2023 12pm-1pm (GMT) and is all about analytical tools that help you use data to make improvements and progress in Healthcare decisions. Make sure to register via Eventbrite in advance to get the link for it.

Last but certainly not least, we are sad to say goodbye to Luke. Back in March he joined our small team. Over [the past six months](https://open-innovations.org/blog/2023-09-22-my-first-6-months-at-open-innovations) or so Luke has learned a lot and [contributed a huge amount to our projects and team](https://open-innovations.org/search/?author=lstrange). Unfortunately for us he will soon be heading off to travel through Central America so this has been his last week. He will be missed but we hope he has a fantastic time.
