{{ comp.anchor({ ref: 'Sprint Planning' }) | safe }}
Last week most of the team were on holiday so we decided to extend sprint 8 by one week, meaning it finished on the 11th. We completed 43 tickets, which is expectedly larger than normal due to the extension. As of Wednesday we are now into sprint 9, which is heavily focused on Leeds 2023, JRF and YFF.
