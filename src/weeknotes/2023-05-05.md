Luke has been working on YFF to improve some of the automation for data visualisations. We should be able to apply this across some of our other projects too, like LSIP and JRF. This will remove even more human intervention with generating the graphs, letting people focus on using the data to answer questions. He has also made a good start on the Joseph Rowntree Foundation project data pipelines, and has written a blog about it. The first part is a non-technical explanation of why, how, and what we are doing. The second, coming soon, will be a technical post explaining how to automatically pull data from the DWP's Stat-Xplore API.
