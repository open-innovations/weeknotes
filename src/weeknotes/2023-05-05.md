Luke has been working on YFF to improve some of the automation for data visualisations. We should be able to apply this across some of our other projects too, like LSIP and JRF. This will remove even more human intervention with generating the graphs, letting people focus on using the data to answer questions. He has also made a good start on the Joseph Rowntree Foundation project data pipelines, and has written a blog about it. The first part is a non-technical explanation of why, how, and what we are doing. The second, coming soon, will be a technical post explaining how to automatically pull data from the DWP's Stat-Xplore API.

The team has held its internal kick-off meeting for an exciting new project working with the Joseph Rowntree Foundation building a North England Insight Finder. This will bring together a vast array of data around poverty in its broadest sense with a key requirement to make it easy to make decisions on the back of the data. There'll be a big data build, visualisation designs and likely some modelling, too, and the project is due for full launch in the autumn but, as always with the Open Innovations team and their #radicallyopen way of working, everything, every step, every line of code will be online from day one. The project page will be live next week, and we'll point you to it then.

Christian has been working with Leeds City Council colleagues with whom we're working as an Economic Data Partner, supporting them to gain greater insight into the local economy, building reproducible pipelines to save them time so they can focus on what they do best, and helping them to answer the difficult questions where data is hard to come by. This week and next week is looking at migration patterns and graduate in-flows and out-flows, and we'll have some results of that up on the website soon. As with the JRF Insight Finder, there'll be a new project page up on the site soon and we'll link it in here when it's ready.
