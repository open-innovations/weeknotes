We finished our third sprint this week. Given the Easter holidays, we decided to run a three-week sprint. The general feeling was that this removed some of the urgency from the sprint cycle. It felt as though some of the tickets were languising somewhat when people returned from holiday. We'll think about this carefully next time a similar situation arises. We also had some issues with loosely defined tickets which then have a tendency to soak up any new requirements that people come up with when reviewing. Perhaps a better way of dealing with this kind of ticket is to close them off, raising a new ticket with the additional, more specific requirements. One to try out. In terms of numbers, we closed off 43 tickets (5 of which were closed with no action). We ended up with 16 tickets dropping through: 6 in review, 1 in progress, 7 ready and 1 backlog. We did scrub the backlog a bit prior to closing the sprint. On the last day of the sprint we ended up moving / removing four or five tickets. One to watch out for!
