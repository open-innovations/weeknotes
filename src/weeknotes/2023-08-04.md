With a few of the team away on holiday for much of August, things will be quieter and we will likely be more sporadic releasing weeknotes. You can still see what we are up to over on [Twitter](@OpenInnovates) (or do we call it X, now?) and we'll be making some new additions to our [website](https://open-innovations.org/) so keep an eye out.

Paul, Taz and Stuart made a trip over to Castleford to meet with one of our oldest sponsors, Northern Powergrid. We've been supporting them with their [DFES](https://open-innovations.org/projects/northernpowergrid/dfes/) for years now, and we're excited to be working on a new project with them over the next few months exploring data on the energy network. We'll announce more details soon.

We've started to use [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/), an in-process SQL OLAP database management system. This has significantly reduced the build time of the site, and therefore increased our workflow. It also gives us immense flexibilty to reshape data on the fly when generating visualsiatons with [OI lume viz](https://open-innovations.github.io/oi-lume-viz/). We're sure that we will use this in future projects; it's been fantastic so far. We're still working through interesting technical challenges, but this project has been invaluable in teaching us how to get the most out of our tools (particular shoutouts to [Lume](https://lume.land/), OI Lume viz, and DuckDB)
