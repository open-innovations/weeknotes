With a few of the team away on holiday for much of August, things will be quieter and we will likely be more sporadic releasing weeknotes. You can still see what we are up to over on [Twitter](@OpenInnovates) (or do we call it X, now?) and we'll be making some new additions to our [website](https://open-innovations.org/) so keep an eye out.

{{ comp.anchor({ ref: 'Northern Powergrid' }) | safe }}
Paul, Taz and Stuart made a trip over to Castleford to meet with one of our oldest sponsors, Northern Powergrid. We've been supporting them with their [DFES](https://open-innovations.org/projects/northernpowergrid/dfes/) for years now, and we're excited to be working on a new project with them over the next few months exploring data on the energy network. We'll announce more details soon.
