Taz has been busy writing up the recent #OpenDataSavesLives event on the theme
of Health Inequalities. You can now view the [recording](https://opendatasaveslives.org/events/session-37-health-inequalities)
and read the [blog post](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/opendatasaveslives-meeting-tickets-566573234797).
This topic has proven really popular, and we'll be coming back to it in our next
session [RAP for Health Inequalities](https://opendatasaveslives.org/events/session-38-rap-for-health-inequalities)
on the 10th May. Visit the event page to find out more and register!




Luke has spent his first week learning about the LSIP project and getting a
grasp on how to visualise data on the Web. He has also been looking at 4
projects on northern economics (Northern economic data, Leveling Up, Coastal
Economies and Knaresborough Connectors) and thinking about where he can add
value. On Thursday he had a meeting with Tom on all things buses, and is
investigating the possible application of machine learning in this area.
