We paused our weeknotes at the start of August for the summer holidays. A busy September meant we forgot to start up again. Well, we're back. So here's our "summer notes"...

Last week we held [an Open Data Showcase](https://open-innovations.org/blog/2023-10-05-open-data-showcase-highlights) as part of Leeds Digital Festival 2023. Lots of people showed up and we had some fantastic talks.

There have been some big updates to the [JRF Insight Finder](https://open-innovations.github.io/jrf-insight/) by Christian, Giles and Luke. We are pretty much at the end of phase 1 and its going to user testing for a while...

Taz and Giles have been continuing work on the [Youth Futures Foundation's Data Dashboard](https://data.youthfuturesfoundation.org/). We are glad to say that the next phase of our work with YFF has been confirmed.

[Taz delivered](https://open-innovations.org/blog/2023-09-15-mapping-creative-education) out [Mapping Creative Education project](https://open-innovations.github.io/leeds-schools-cultural-engagement/) for the University of Leeds. It aims to help them to understand how Leeds schools are engaging with arts and culture by improving the availability of data on cultural engagement within schools in Leeds.

Over the summer, Luke and Stuart have been creating [a website of constituency data](constituencies.open-innovations.org/) shown on constituency cartograms.

Stuart has been keeping [our analysis of the Register of Members Financial Interests](https://open-innovations.org/projects/RMFI/index.html) up-to-date.

We've added [waffle charts](https://open-innovations.github.io/oi-lume-viz/samples/chart/waffle/) and [ridgeline charts](https://open-innovations.github.io/oi-lume-viz/samples/chart/ridgeline/) to OI Lume Viz.

Stuart created a [tool to create lookups between two different geographies](https://open-innovations.github.io/geography-lookup-builder/) based on the area of overlap.

And last but not least, next week is Luke's last week before he heads off on his travels.
