We paused our weeknotes at the start of August for the summer holidays. A busy September meant we forgot to start up again. Well, we're back. Here's what we've been up to:

{{ comp.anchor({ ref: 'Showcase' }) | safe }}  Last week we held [an Open Data Showcase](https://open-innovations.org/blog/2023-10-05-open-data-showcase-highlights) as part of Leeds Digital Festival 2023. Lots of people showed up and we had some fantastic talks.

{{ comp.anchor({ ref: 'JRF' }) | safe }} There have been some big updates to the [JRF Insight Finder](https://open-innovations.github.io/jrf-insight/). We are pretty much at the end of phase 1 and its going to user testing for a while...

{{ comp.anchor({ ref 'YFF' }) | safe }} Taz and Giles have been continuing work on the [Youth Futures Foundation's Data Dashboard](https://data.youthfuturesfoundation.org/). We are glad to say that the next phase of our work with YFF has been confirmed.

{{ comp.anchor({ ref: 'Constituencies' }) | safe }} Over the summer, Luke and Stuart have been creating [a website of constituency data](constituencies.open-innovations.org/) shown on constituency cartograms.

{{ comp.anchor({ ref: 'RMFI' }) | safe }} Stuart has been keeping [our analysis of the Register of Members Financial Interests](https://open-innovations.org/projects/RMFI/index.html) up-to-date.

{{ comp.anchor({ ref: 'OILumeViz' }) | safe }} We've added [waffle charts](https://open-innovations.github.io/oi-lume-viz/samples/chart/waffle/) and [ridgeline charts](https://open-innovations.github.io/oi-lume-viz/samples/chart/ridgeline/) to OI Lume Viz.

{{ comp.anchor({ ref: 'GeographyLookup' }) | safe }} Stuart created a [tool to create lookups between two different geographies](https://open-innovations.github.io/geography-lookup-builder/) based on the area of overlap.

And last but not least, next week is Luke's last week before he heads off on his travels.
