{{ comp.anchor({ ref: 'trees' }) | safe }} Stuart has written a long-delayed [blog post about open approaches to building databases of trees](https://open-innovations.org/blog/2023-05-23-where-are-all-the-trees). Too many crowd-sourced tree-mapping projects seem to become silos of closed data. They should be more open.

{{ comp.anchor({ ref: 'leeds' }) | safe }} Christian has been working more closely on labour mobility data for our project with Leeds City Council. Through analysis of the ONS Labour Force Survey, we're starting to build a model which looks at how many people commute into Leeds, and how that differs by industry and occupation. Next steps (after a much-needed break for half-term) will be connecting this to compensation of employees data in both the GVA statistics (production) and gross disposable household income statistics (income) to see if we can estimate how much money 'earned' in Leeds is taken home for spending elsewhere. Blog post coming in the first week of May!

{{ comp.anchor({ ref: 'jrf' }) | safe }} Christian, Giles and Luke had a long and productive working session with colleagues from JRF as we begin to develop the first prototype for our Poverty Insight tool for North England. *Triangulation* was the word of the meeting, where we disucssed that it's how data across domains interacts that is at least, if not more, important than data within anyone domain. This is going to be a fascinating project!
