* Stuart has added another 17 directories of warm spaces - mostly from local authorities - to the [Warm Spaces directory of directories](https://open-innovations.github.io/warm-spaces/) taking the number of [searchable warm spaces](https://open-innovations.github.io/warm-spaces/find) up to 7991.
* Giles & Stuart chatted with Parliamentary library people about our project on the Register of Members Interests.
* Work has continued supporting the Distribution Future Energy Scenario (DFES) visualisations for both Northern Powergrid and UK Power Networks by fixing bugs that have arisen from edge cases in the data and adding some new options. Because we are re-using much of the core code between the two DFES projects (and the FES project for National Grid), it means we can apply the improvements to both.
* An enthusiastic student from CSU Sacramento got in touch with us about [bins of the world](https://odileeds.github.io/osmedit/bins/). They are taking inspiration from it to map the trash cans and recycling bins on campus using OpenStreetMap and then showing the results on a map (they will probably use the [Overpass API](http://overpass-turbo.eu/) results [e.g. amenity=waste_basket within a bounding box around their campus](https://overpass-api.de/api/interpreter?data=[bbox%3A38.55288093010608%2C-121.43398761749268%2C38.56804900435959%2C-121.41134977340698][out%3Ajson][timeout%3A25]%3B(node[%22amenity%22%3D%22waste_basket%22]%3B)%3Bout%3B%3E%3Bout%20skel%20qt%3B%0A))
