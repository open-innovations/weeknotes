[Seasons greetings from the Open Innovations team](https://open-innovations.org/advent/card-2022/).

* Stuart has added another 23 directories of warm spaces - mostly from local authorities - to the [Warm Spaces directory of directories](https://open-innovations.github.io/warm-spaces/) taking the number of [searchable warm spaces](https://open-innovations.github.io/warm-spaces/find) up to 8431. It has crossed our minds that someone could take our [compiled, geo-coded, JSON of warm space offers](https://github.com/open-innovations/warm-spaces/blob/main/docs/data/places.json) and compare this with the [Indoors Sub-domain Rank](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/indices-futures-updating-the-english-indices-of-deprivation-iod-consultation/indices-futures-updating-the-english-indices-of-deprivation-iod-consultation#living-environment-deprivation-domain) of the [English indices of deprivation 2019](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2019) to find out if offers are in the areas with the most need. Perhaps creating something like [Open Data Manchester's lava lamp plot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenDataManchester/indices-of-deprivation/master/imd19/lava-lamp-plots/IMD19%20A2%20FINAL.png).
* Giles & Stuart chatted with Parliamentary library people about our project on the Register of Members Interests.
* Work has continued supporting the Distribution Future Energy Scenario (DFES) visualisations for both Northern Powergrid and UK Power Networks by fixing bugs that have arisen from edge cases in the data and adding some new options. Because we are re-using much of the core code between the two DFES projects (and the FES project for National Grid), it means we can apply the improvements to both.
* An enthusiastic student from CSU Sacramento got in touch with us about our [bins of the world](https://odileeds.github.io/osmedit/bins/) visualisation. They are taking inspiration from it to map the trash cans and recycling bins on campus using OpenStreetMap and then showing the results on a map (they will probably use the [Overpass API](http://overpass-turbo.eu/) results [e.g. amenity=waste_basket within a bounding box around their campus](https://overpass-api.de/api/interpreter?data=[bbox%3A38.55288093010608%2C-121.43398761749268%2C38.56804900435959%2C-121.41134977340698][out%3Ajson][timeout%3A25]%3B(node[%22amenity%22%3D%22waste_basket%22]%3B)%3Bout%3B%3E%3Bout%20skel%20qt%3B%0A))
* Paul has been speaking to lots of people about cultural data e.g. https://twitter.com/paulcconnell/status/1603101121324752899?s=20&t=rG2lI8g-X9Ox5_HCs2jzNA
* Paul has been working with to Stuart Clarke from Leeds Digital Festival about helping them to update The Leeds Tech Map in 2023 https://paceline.digital/leeds-tech-map/
* JRF have been in touch with Paul about working with us to create the Data Infrastructure for North England.
* Daniel has created [a hex map of Arts Council England funding](https://open-innovations.github.io/arts-council-england-funding/).
* Christian has been in kick-off meetings and a data workshop with Leeds City Council as we look to answer some of their commonly-asked but hard-to-find-out questions over the coming year. Keep an eye out for our launch blog post in the new year.
