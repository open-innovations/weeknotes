- Christian has been working on our LSIP project with West & North Yorkshire Chamber of Commerce, and the data pipelines are now starting to appear on microsites thanks to the work of Giles. He's also been taking a look at Council Tax as part of our Tax Devolution work with the Northern Powerhouse Partnership. There'll be lots more to say on this next week but, if the engagement of a [single tweet](https://twitter.com/ChristianSpence/status/1621065091213938688) on this is anything to go by, there'll be lots of interest as more data crunching continues!
