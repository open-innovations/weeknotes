  This week, we've been adding more content to our Open Innovations Platform, which is coming together nicely. We're also making great progress with YFF's economic dashboard and will be presenting our latest work with them next week.

In addition to supporting Luke and Taz with the YFF visualisation work, Giles has been refining the [LEEDS 2023 Data Microsite](https://data.leeds2023.co.uk). He has also written up an important part of the Open Innovations Platform: the use of the [Lume static site generator](https://open-innovations.github.io/platform/tech-stack/static-site-generation/). This tool underpins a huge amount of the work that we are doing at the moment. We're still in reasonably early days defining conventions and ways of using this powerful tool, so this has been a great opportunity to reflect.

This week Taz has been building visualisations of various ONS data sources for YFF's economic dashboard. We have been thinking about how we can reproduce all of our economic analysis and visualisations, so next week will be spent building on YFF's economic dashboard and improving how we extract ONS data for future projects!
