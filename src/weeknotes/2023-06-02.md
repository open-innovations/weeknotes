  While Michelle and Taz consolidated the delivery work so far on YFF,
  more or less everyone else was out of the office on holiday.

Quite a few of the team were out for the holidays, enjoying the weather.
It should have been a "new sprint week", but the dedicated few left in the office decided to extend until more folk were in.

Michelle and Taz held the fort, and were busy getting and actioning feedback on the work we've done
on the [Youth Futures Foundation project](https://open-innovations.org/projects/youth-futures-foundation/).
They wrote
[a blog post about Phase 2 work](https://open-innovations.org/blog/2023-06-02-youth-futures-foundation-phase-2)
which explains in more detail what we've been up to.
They also interviewed one of the key YFF project sponsors about the benefits YFF are hoping to realise by creating the data dashboard.
An edited transcript of this interview will be published soon.

Don't forget, the 8th June sees the [Leeds Data Ethics Forum](https://open-innovations.org/events/e/ldef).
We are looking to build initiative in this area to work on making Leeds a leading 'Safe Digital City'.

Normal weeknote service will be resumed next week!
