* After helping [Open Benches](https://www.openbenches.org/) to dramatically reduce the page load of their homepage, Stuart wrote up a blog post with [tips for optimising GeoJSON files](https://open-innovations.org/blog/2023-07-25-tips-for-optimising-geojson-files).

* At some point in the next year or two it is expected there will be a General Election. That always gets us thinking about constituency hex cartograms. Paul has proposed that we have a place that lets people see various things (TBD) on hex cartograms. We are thinking we will make a site using our [OI Lume Viz](https://open-innovations.github.io/oi-lume-viz/) visualisation tools. In preparation for the sorts of things we might want to be able to do, Stuart has been adding the option for [interactive sliders](https://open-innovations.github.io/oi-lume-viz/samples/map/hex-cartogram/#example-11).
